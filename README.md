## Hanoi Building <sub>(Using Dynamic_Memory_Allocation)</sub>
#### This class only conludes one function named *solve(num_discs, src, dst, tmp)*
#### Meanings of Parameters: 
- num_discs: the number of discs you want to move from one point(indicated by a number1/2/3) to another point(indicated by a number1/2/3)
- src: the point(indicated by a number1/2/3) you want move discs from
- dst: the point(indicated by a number1/2/3) you want move discs to
- tmp: the point(indicated by a number1/2/3) you want use temperary point to hold discs
#### The sample result you will get:
If you want to move 2 discs from 1 to 2, the results/steps you will get is: <br /> <br />
Below, 'A->B' means 'move the top disc on pole A to pole B' <br />
1->3 <br />
1->2 <br />
3->2 <br />

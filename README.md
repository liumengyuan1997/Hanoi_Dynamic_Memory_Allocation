Meanings of Parameters: <br />
- num_discs: the number of discs you want to move from one point(indicated by a number1/2/3) to another point(indicated by a number1/2/3)
- src: the point(indicated by a number1/2/3) you want move discs from
- dst: the point(indicated by a number1/2/3) you want move discs to
- tmp: the point(indicated by a number1/2/3) you want use temperary point to hold discs
